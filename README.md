-   Development Process:
I started with HTML to help myself visualize structure and put names to pieces that would build the rest of the game. Next I built the game engine. Taking breaks throughout to add the CSS so that I could visualize the moves and changes I was implementing. I added in all of the auth buttons shortly after. And finished with the API.

-   Changes I Will Make:
The layout and user interface will need to be improved significantly in terms of their overall appearance, and in the way that it reacts to user prompts. The code on the board can also be simplified.
